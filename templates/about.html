      When I'm not coding or geeking out over the latest advancements in technology, you'll find me glued to the tennis court, either playing or cheering on my current favorite player, <span class="highlight">Carlos Alcaraz Garfia</span>. ðŸŽ¾ I'm also a huge fan of anime and Netflix seriesâ€”seriously, don't get me started unless you're ready for a full-on discussion! ðŸ“º Media, in general, fascinates me because of its power to inspire and connect people.
